// Problem 2: Bank and Account Holders (Association)
// Description: Model a relationship where a Bank has Customer objects associated with it. A Customer can have multiple bank accounts, and each account is linked to a Bank.
// Tasks:
// Define a Bank class and a Customer class.
// Use an association relationship to show that each customer has an account in a bank.
// Implement methods that enable communication, such as openAccount() in the Bank class and viewBalance() in the Customer class.
// Goal: Illustrate association by setting up a relationship between customers and the bank.

//  Problem 1: Library and Books (Aggregation)
// // Description: Create a Library class that contains multiple Book objects. Model the relationship such that a library can have many books, but a book can exist independently (outside of a specific library).
// // Tasks:
// // Define a Library class with an ArrayList of Book objects.
// // Define a Book class with attributes such as title and author.
// // Demonstrate the aggregation relationship by creating books and adding them to different libraries.
// // Goal: Understand aggregation by modeling a real-world relationship where the Library aggregates Book objects.
public class Book {

	private String title;
	private String author;
	public Book(String title, String author) {
		this.title = title;
		this.author = author;

	}

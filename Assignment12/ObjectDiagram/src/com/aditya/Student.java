// Problem 1: School and Students with Courses (Association and Aggregation)
// Description: Model a School with multiple Student objects, where each student can enroll in multiple courses, and each course can have multiple students.
// Tasks:

// Model an association between Student and Course to show that students can enroll in multiple courses.
// Model an aggregation relationship between School and Student.

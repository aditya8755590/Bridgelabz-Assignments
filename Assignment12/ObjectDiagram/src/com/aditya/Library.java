// Problem 1: Library and Books (Aggregation)
// Description: Create a Library class that contains multiple Book objects. Model the relationship such that a library can have many books, but a book can exist independently (outside of a specific library).
// Tasks:
// Define a Library class with an ArrayList of Book objects.
// Define a Book class with attributes such as title and author.
// Demonstrate the aggregation relationship by creating books and adding them to different libraries.
// Goal: Understand aggregation by modeling a real-world relationship where the Library aggregates Book objects.

	private ArrayList<Book> books;

	public Library() {
		books = new ArrayList<>();	
		
	}
